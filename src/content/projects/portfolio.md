## Project Overview

I designed a custom personal portfolio website, from scratch, using [Astro](https://astro.build)! This is a live website, meaning I will continue to update it as I grow. I am hoping to use it to present some cool stuff, some stuff I like, and some neat design.

## Design Process

From a code perspective, I am approaching the design of this website with a focus on writing clean and scalable code. Ensuring that it is easy to update the website with new projects, features, or design is a critical priority. That means designing with expansion and configurability in mind, using detailed comments when necessary, and using a logical line of reasoning in my structure.
